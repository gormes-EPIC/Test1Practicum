# Test 1: Practicum

1. Using the generic `LinkedList` in this project, write a `Stack` that is implemented using a `LinkedList`. It should contain the following methods: `push, pop, peek, size` and `isEmpty`.
2. Create a set of test cases with 80% coverage to test your class.
3. Write Javadoc comments for your Stack class and generate a Javadoc HTML reference. 

 You may not use the internet(other than to upload your project to GitHub Classroom) or any other external resources.
